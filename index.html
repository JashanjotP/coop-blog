            I was offered a position to work at Ontario Power Generation as a Co-op Student. During my 4-month co-op at Ontario Power Generation (part of an 8-month term),
			 I gained valuable experience working with a collaborative team on several key projects. While I can't go into specifics due to the confidential nature of the work, this experience 
			 allowed me to develop new skills and deepen my understanding of the industry.
